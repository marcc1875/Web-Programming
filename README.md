# Web-Programming

# Initial Commit - index.html
I commited an initial template website to get a feel for commiting, what change it made to the respitory and also how it would be displayed.

# Version 2 - index.html
I made some changes to the index.html file, and then commited those changes as a second version. This has allowed me to see the chnages made, go back to the previous version, and give me a feel for version control within my Web-Programming repository.

# Version 3 - index.html 

I have added some html code to create a list that would represent a navigation bar. With this I have implemented some embedded JavaScript to create the hyperlink to the webpage depending on which university you click on.

# Version 4 - index.html

I have moved the embedded html into an external javaScript file and added the line of code in the script tags to link this, to make the code neater and less cluttered.

# Version 5 - index.html

I have added the <style> line to download the jQuery library for the javaScript on my webpage

# Version 6 - index.html

I have added some divisions to allow for JQuery in Version 3 of add.js to be used on them.

# Initial Commit - styles.css

I have commited an external css sheet that will link with index.html to apply and edit the style of the website
This also includes some css to create a horizontal navigation bar.

# Initial Commit - add.js

I have added an external javaScript file to neaten up my html file, and help make the code less cluttered and more neater. I moved the earlier commited embedded js code into this file.

# Version 2 - add.js

I have added some JQuery in the javascript file to allow the user to click on a paragraph they have already read and it will hide it.

# Version 3 - add.ks

I have added some more JQuery to test out some more features that it allows you to do, and get more of a feel for the syntax and what it actually does
