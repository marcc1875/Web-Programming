# Web-Programming

# Initial Commit
I commited an initial template website to get a feel for commiting, what change it made to the respitory and also how it would be displayed.

# Version 2 - index.html
I made some changes to the index.html file, and then commited those changes as a second version. This has allowed me to see the chnages made, go back to the previous version, and give me a feel for version control within my Web-Programming repository.
