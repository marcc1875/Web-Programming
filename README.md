# Initial Commit - basicArrays.js
I have added a basicArrays.js file with some code that I used to create arrays and do some very basic editing with them. I have messed around with the code, including syntax, to get a feel for what syntax is neccessary for the code to run properly.

# Version 2 - basicArrays.js
I have added some more code within the js file that I have used to extend my knowledge with how to make use of and edit arrays.

# Initial Commit - colors.js
I have added a new file called colors.js that demonstrates how to make a table of random colors, this is the implementation of creating the hue for the colors

# Version 2 - colors.js
I have now updated the colors.js file to add the implementation for creating the table for the random colors, I have messed around and tested with this to see the result, and how the script comes to that result
